# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a web-based implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides an engaging and user-friendly interface for players to enjoy the classic game on their web browser.

The project incorporates HTML markup to create a 3x3 grid, where players can make their moves by clicking on the buttons representing each cell. CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal of the game, including background gradients, button designs, and responsive layout, ensuring an enjoyable experience across different devices and screen sizes.

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, which handles player turns, checks for win conditions, and tracks the progress of the game. When a player achieves a winning combination or when all cells are filled without a winner, the game notifies the players through pop-up messages. Players have the option to restart the game or start a new game after completion.

This Tic Tac Toe project serves as a valuable resource for learning basic web development concepts, as it demonstrates the practical implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating an interactive game. It can be used as a starting point for further customization and enhancement, or simply enjoyed as a standalone game for leisure and entertainment.
